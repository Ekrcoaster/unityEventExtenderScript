# Unity Event Extender - Make the Event System Better!
A tiny modification to make the unity events work nicer. It does this by adding a few new features:

- while hovering over the event, pressing "a" will add a blank event
- while hovering over the event, pressing "d" will copy the selected event
- you are now able to drag and drop gameobjects / scripts to the event


# How to install
- Download the unityEventExtended.cs file
- Place it in any "Editor" folder in unity. It should work!

Let me know if it can be improved or tweaked in any way! I'd love to add the ability to store enums/colors in the event ui itself, but I'm not sure how!
